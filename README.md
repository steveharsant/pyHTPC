# pyHTPC
An (unfinished) python based web launcher HTPC interface with flask. This is very much in an alpha state, but it is usable. See README for more info

## Usage

- Clone or download the repository to anywhere that suits you.
- `pip3 install virtualenv` if you dont have `virtualenv` already. (optional but recommended)
- Create a virutal environment (optional but recommended)
- Execute `export FLASK_APP=app.py; flask run` to run the application on the flask test webserver. It is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- For a more immersive experience (and if using Chrome), run: `google-chrome http://127.0.0.1:5000 --kiosk`
